### DismalSim
Digraph-based macroeconomic simulation implemented in Python

This simulation is supposed to aid in a research project asking the following question: "Given a causal framework with defined linkages of causation between economic variables, what is the nature of the relationships between those variables?" Building on Geoffrey Wyatt's theoretical framework as laid out in _Macroeconomic Models in a Causal Framework,_ this project seeks to test Wyatt's ideas by implementing a simulation and using empirical data.

The digraph is going to have the following nodes:
* GDP
* Government spending
* Taxes
* Consumption spending
* Balance of trade
* Exports
* The interest rate
* The money supply
